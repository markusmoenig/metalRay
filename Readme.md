This is a concept study if it is possible to create an Xcode project with support of the C based [rayLib](https://raylib.com) API, implemented in Metal. While providing the same functionality also in Swift.

So far the answer is yes, rayLib based games would only need very minor modifications to be able to run natively in Metal while being able to be deployed easily to macOS, iOS and tvOS.

The rayLib API is also available in Swift, so games could also be implemented purely in Swift, C and Swift can also be mixed.

While it is possible, it is also a lot of work. I will try to get the 2D API with most of the core module working first in the next weeks.
